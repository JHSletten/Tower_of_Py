# Tower_of_Py
#### A CS101 final project through Codecademy

**The Tower of Py** is a simple text based fantasy computer game. You can pick one of three classes to play (Fighter, Wizard, Paladin) and attempt to fight your way through challenging encounters in the Tower of Py.

The program is written entirely in Python 3.9 (Windows) and is played in the command line. To play the game you need to download these files:
* classes.py
* functions.py
* materials.py
* run.py

You access the game itself by running the run.py file. 

OR 
you can play the game in your browser here:

#### My experience and purpose for making this game:
*I wrote this program to apply my basic python abalities to create a fairly simple fantasy text based video game. This was a very useful experience. I saw how the smallest tasks could need large amounts of robust and logical code. I got experience using GitHub, and I've made mistakes I'm planning on not repeating.*
